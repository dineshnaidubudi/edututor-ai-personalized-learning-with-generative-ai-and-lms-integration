🎓 EduTutor AI
EduTutor AI is an intelligent, interactive web-based learning assistant that enables students to:

Take quizzes in topics like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Generative AI, and Mathematics

Ask any question and receive detailed answers using powerful language models

View question-answer history for better learning

Enable educators to view a simple performance dashboard

🚀 Features
Student Panel:

📚 Take subject-based multiple-choice quizzes

❓ Ask open-ended questions to an AI model (powered by Hugging Face Transformers)

🧾 View your recent questions and answers

Educator Panel:

📊 Monitor quiz performance (basic dashboard; extensible for future analytics)

Model Integration:

🔗 Integrated with Hugging Face’s google/flan-t5-xl or custom fallback models

🤖 Supports GPU acceleration (if available)

📡 Uses Hugging Face's hosted inference API or loads model locally (if configured)

📦 Requirements
Make sure the following are installed:

bash
Copy
Edit
Python 3.8+
CUDA-compatible GPU (optional for acceleration)
🔧 Installation Steps (Windows / Local Machine)

📝 Usage Notes
For local model usage, ensure transformers, torch, and accelerate are installed properly.

If using Hugging Face API, monitor usage as free-tier has rate limits.

The app does not store quiz or question-answer history in a database yet—this can be extended using SQLite, Firebase, or Supabase.
